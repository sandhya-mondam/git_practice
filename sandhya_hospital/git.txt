1. traverse to your folder (floweazy_training):
2. git clone "paste the link "
3. git branch --> will show you in which branch you are in
4. git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name (branch name should be something that is already in git)
5. git checkout branch_name (takes you to the partciular branch inside local)



creating new branch :
1. create a branch from master branch
git checkout -b dev_sandhya_minor_imp origin/main (only in local system)
git diff (for all difference)
git diff file (to have a look at difference in the particular file)

2. Push code to staging server:

git add file_name
git pull origin main
git commit -m "[IMP/ADD] comment"
git branch -rm branch_name (to change to another branch)
git fetch --all -p  (to fetch all the changes in all branches)
git merge my_branch origin/main_branch
git branch -a ( all branches you can see)
git push origin -d branch_name (local to server)
git push origin -d ( branch will get deleted in git)
